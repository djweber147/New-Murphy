                <h5>About the project</h5>
				<p>This project was commissioned after a catastrophe occurred with the University of St. Thomas Murphy Registration system over the course of registration in November 2018. We have been tasked with improving the system that is already out there. 
				Murphy online has not been updated to a more current, modern look, but is sitting in the past. The following four pictures will help describe the 
				changes that we have made.</p>
                <img src="img/searchOld1.jpg" style="width: 100%"/><br><br>
				<img src="img/searchOld2.jpg" style="width: 100%"/><br><br>
				<img src="img/searchOld3.jpg" style="width: 100%"/><br><br>
				<img src="img/searchOld4.jpg" style="width: 100%"/><br><br>
				<p> First of all, our prototype allows one to combine all four of these pages: we have what you schedule will look like, your subject search 
				function, your section viewing and a filtering based on crn and course number. Second, we have implemented a system that automatically moves 
				people around in classes according to their preferences: add, drop, drop from waitlist. Third, class capacity numbers update as people register 
				so students can see how many people are registering for a curtain class. Our system is a mix between Class Finder and Murphy where it has a class 
				finder feel to it, yet it uses, and simplifies, the current registration system. Lastly, we implemented a major improvement upon the current 
				graphics used in Murphy to make it more astatically pleasing.</p>
