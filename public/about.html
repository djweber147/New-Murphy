For the first two and a half years at St. Thomas, I was a memeber of St. John Vianney Seminary studying Philosophy and Catholic Studies. When I left the seminary, I decide to add a Computer Science major. I have loved studying this and will begin working at software consulting company in January. Some of my hobbies are bowling, playing guitar, and singing.
